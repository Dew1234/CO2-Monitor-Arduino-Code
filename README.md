# CO2-Monitor-Arduino-Code
This was arduino code that was written for a device that is able to detect respiratory blockage through transcutaneous monitoring of internal carbon dioxide. This device was designed to be portable and wearable, so it could be used during daily, everyday activities to detect respiratory blockage and send out an alert to caregivers that are nearby. A Makerbot 3D printer was also used to develop the parts for the device. 

This code includes functions such as thermal and pressure detection with a BMP 180 module, temperature regulation through PWM (generated with nichrome wire), integration with the COZIR K-Series CO2 sensor, regulation of a miniature vacuum tube, and implementation of a bluetooth module for wireless connectivity with the device.

The project has also been filed for a patent by the US Patent Department: https://www.google.com/patents/US20160249838
